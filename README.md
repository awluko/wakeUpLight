# wakeUpLight

This is a script for working with a 12 LED NeoPixel ring and a Raspberry Pi Zero WH. This should work regardless of the make of the Raspberry Pi you have. 

This is currently built for the use case for my wife and I, based on our works schedules. There are plans to continue updating it over time. Ideally there will eventually be a web app that will allow for more dynamic control of the scheduled times. For the time being, the parameters are being passed in the function calls based on the lists in wakeUpLight.py.
